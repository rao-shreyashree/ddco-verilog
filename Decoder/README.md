# Decoder (2-to-4)

This folder contains the Verilog implementation and simulation assets for a 2-to-4 binary decoder. The decoder activates one of four outputs based on a 2-bit binary input.

## Files Included

- `decoder24.v`: Verilog module for the 2-to-4 decoder
- `decoder24_tb.v`: Testbench to verify decoder functionality
- `decoder24.vcd`: Waveform output from simulation
- `decoder24_sim`: Simulation file or log

## Highlights

- Active-high output decoding based on binary input
- Testbench covers all input combinations and edge cases
- Waveform (`.vcd`) viewable in GTKWave for signal verification
- Modular design supports integration into larger control systems
